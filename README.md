# Traits Predictor

## Brief Introduction

This is a simple Python personality predictor. Basically, it will cluster all users with Big Five test style, and try to group users by the same trait.

### Methods

- Unigram
- K-means
- Multiple layer perceptron
- Support Vector Machines
- Nearest Neighbors

### Features
- Predicting users' personality traits.
- Grouping people by users' personality trait

### Data

User selection is randomly selected from [here](http://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/), and the word feature data is collected from [here](https://github.com/mhbashari/NRC-Persian-Lexicon). For the training data, is collected from [here](http://mypersonality.org/wiki/doku.php?id=download_databases)
